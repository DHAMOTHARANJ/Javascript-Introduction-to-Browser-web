1. HTTP1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP2 which was created in 2015

HTTP1.1 usest works on the textual format where as HTTP2 works on the binary protocol

There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources where as allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests

HTTP1.1 compresses data by itself, HTTP2 uses HPACK for data compression.

2. Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.
